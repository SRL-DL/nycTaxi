`nycTaxi_rf.ipynb` contains my work for the New York City Taxi Fare Prediction Kaggle playground competition. I employ a Random Forest Regressor to predict the fare of a New Yrk City yellow taxi using data that would be available at the start of the ride.
Random Forests are an ensemble learning method that bag together several decision trees to correct for their tendency to overfit.
